 * System sorts:

 * Correct
 * The Java API for \verb#Arrays.sort()#Arrays.sort()
 * for reference types requires that it is stable and guarantees
 * n \log nnlogn performance. Neither of these are properties of standard quicksort.
 *
 * Quicksort uses less memory and is faster
 * in practice on typical inputs (and is typically used by
 * \verb#Arrays.sort()#Arrays.sort() when sorting primitive types,
 * where stability is not relevant).
